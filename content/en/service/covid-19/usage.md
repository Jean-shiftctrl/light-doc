### Anonymous Users

For users who are not registered, they can access the system in read-only mode. Most impotantly, they can search and filter the registered entities (personal and buisness) on the map and access their status. 


Once you know the userId of the target entity from the map, you can access the status directly with a URL and a query parameter.
