### Short Term

The short term goal is to get people, businesses connected based on Geolocation. As a user, you can register yourself as a requester who needs some help from neighbors, or a volunteer who offers support to others in the neighborhood. For a local business, you can register as a vendor and keep publishing the status of your operation and connect to the people in your community. 

### Midium Term

In the medium term, we want to add more features like news publishing, blog posting, local community forums, etc. The category and subcategory of the entity are open to add more. 


### Long Term

In the long run, we might integrate it with our Taiji blockchain and cryptocurrency to make it a full-blown social application.
