To update the user profile, you need to Sign In first. Once logged in, you can click the user icon and select the Profile menu. The user profile will be displayed in a JSON format with EDIT and DELETE buttons. By clicking the EDIT, you can change the user profile on the user update form. If you click the DELETE button, the user profile will be deleted from the system. Once the user is deleted, the user email cannot be used to log in anymore.
