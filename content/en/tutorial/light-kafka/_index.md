We are using the light-kafka and light-hybrid-4j for the light-portal, light-blockchain and open-banking applications with Event Sourcing and CQRS, so it is easier for us to provider examples with hybrid framework. As a lot of our users are still using light-rest-4j, we want to provide an additional example in REST.
