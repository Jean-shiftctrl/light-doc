As part of [light-mesh](/service/mesh/) offering, the [Kafka Sidecar](/service/mesh/kafka/) is an infrastructure component to help businesses to build services interacting with enterprise Kafka clusters. In this tutorial, I will outline the major steps to get the sidecar and backend API up and running with a local Confluent and up to production deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. 

* [Local development][] with [Confluent local][]
* [Local binary][] demo with externalized configuration
