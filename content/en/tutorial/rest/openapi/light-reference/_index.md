While working on the [react-schema-form-rc-select](https://github.com/networknt/react-schema-form-rc-select) project, there are several examples on the [live demo](http://networknt.github.io/react-schema-form-rc-select/) site need to access and reference API on the Internet to get the dropdown list dynamically. 

To enable the live demo from the networknt.github.io/react-schema-form-rc-select site, we need to start an instance of light-reference API and deploy it to the test cloud environment. In this tutorial, I am going to document all the steps so that new users can use this tutorial to build their own APIs with light-rest-4j.
