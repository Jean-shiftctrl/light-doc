In the previous [router][] step, we have exposed the services to the Internet through https://ob.lightapi.net subdomain. Eventually, the services will be consumed by other services, single page applications or mobile applications. In this step, we are going to build a consumer application using React and deploy it to the light-router instance on the portal as another virtual host.
