The specifications are based on the [Account and Transaction API Specification][] from OpenBankingUK. And the original repository can be found at https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/account-info-api-spec

The original specification is Swagger 2.0, and it is designed as a monolithic API with one spec. We first convert it to OpenAPI 3.0 format and then break it up into several microservices. 

[Account and Transaction API Specification]: https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1077805296/Account+and+Transaction+API+Specification+-+v3.1.2

Open Banking specification contains too many endpoints, and we cannot implement all microservices but only 4 of them for demonstration purposes. 


### accounts

The specification can be found in the [accounts](https://github.com/open-banking/model-config/tree/master/ob/accounts) folder of the model-config repository. 

### balances

The specification can be found in the [balances](https://github.com/open-banking/model-config/tree/master/ob/balances) folder of the model-config repository. 

### parties

The specification can be found in the [parties](https://github.com/open-banking/model-config/tree/master/ob/parties) folder of the model-config repository. 

### transactions

The specification can be found in the [transactions](https://github.com/open-banking/model-config/tree/master/ob/transactions) folder of the model-config repository. 

If you look at the above specifications, each microservices has two endpoints â€” one with a specific account number and one without an account number. 

All accounts are associated with a user that is passed in from the OAuth 2.0 token. If there is no specific account number, then all the accounts related to the user will be retrieved. Otherwise, a particular account will be retrieved. 

In order to simulate the microservices calling each other, the accounts service will call the balances and transactions to get the balance and last transaction amount when a particular account number is used in the endpoint. 

When light-proxy is introduced, we are going to put a proxy in front of the transactions service to simulate that transactions API is built with another language/framework other than Java/Light-4j.
