Reference API is a microservice designed to populate UI dropdown lists in real-time with relationship support. Try the [link](https://maproot.net/#/app/form/covidMapForm) for a demo react-schema-form. 

In the above form, you have to select a country before the province is populated from the reference API. Once a province is select, the cities in the province will be populated in real-time. The category and subcategory have a similar relationship.
