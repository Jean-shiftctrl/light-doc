In light-hybrid-4j, it is very easy to support multiple versions of the same service running at the same time. In this tutorial, we are going to demo the light-codegen web service with the release version and snapshot version running at the same time in a same light-hybrid-4j instance. 

For the official deployment, the light-codegen is deployed as part of the light-portal. To make it easier for users to follow the tutorial, we are going to create a separate hybrid instance and config folder for light-codegen.
