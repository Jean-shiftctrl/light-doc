In the previous [View React UI developer][] tutorial, we have described how to deploy the dev.lightapi.net and dev.signin.lightapi.net on the test cloud to support UI developers to leverage all services in the cloud without installing anything locally. It is very convenient for UI developers because they only need to start the Nodejs server to develop locally with hot reload, and all the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow interactions with backend services are handled already. But what if we want to debug the interaction with the light-oauth2 from the UI, or we want to update the backend services and test them from the UI. For a full-stack developer, he/she needs to get everything deployed on the local desktop or laptop so that he/she can even work without Internet access. 

In this tutorial, we are going to show users how to deploy the light-oauth2 and light-router locally to allow the React app to access.
